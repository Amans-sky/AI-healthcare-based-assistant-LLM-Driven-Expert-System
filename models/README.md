# Model Weights for Healthcare AI Assistant

This folder is reserved for the LLaMA model weights used by the Healthcare AI Assistant.  
The weights are **not included in this repository** due to their size and licensing restrictions.

## Supported Versions
- **Q4 (Quantized)** – Optimized for speed and lower memory usage.
- **Q8 (Quantized)** – Optimized for better precision, requires more RAM.

## Download Instructions
1. Obtain access to the official LLaMA weights from the respective provider or authorized source.
2. Download the Q4 or Q8 version (depending on your system capabilities).
3. Place the model files inside this folder (`models/`).

Example folder structure after adding weights:
```

models/
├─ llama-q4.bin
└─ llama-q8.bin

```

## Notes
- Ensure you comply with the licensing terms of the model provider.
- Do not commit or push the weights to this repository if they exceed GitHub size limits or violate licensing.

### **3. GitHub-Ready Upload Package**

Here’s what you should include when uploading to GitHub:

* `app.ipynb` (your main notebook)
* `README.md` (the professional one I gave)
* `models/README.md` (above content)
* `requirements.txt` (with `llama-cpp-python`, `fastapi`, `streamlit`, etc.)
* `data/` (if you have a sample)
* `.gitignore` (to exclude `models/*` and unnecessary cache)

Would you like me to:

1. **Create all these files now and give you as a `.zip`** (ready to upload to GitHub),
2. Or give you the **exact step-by-step GitHub upload guide** with these files?
3. Or **both**?
Great! I’ll prepare **all three** for you step by step:
